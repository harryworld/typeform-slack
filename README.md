# typeform-slack

This tool is being updated, we want to create a tool which can read data from Typeform and send invitation in Slack. This is combined of the plugin as well as a management system on the users signed up.

1. Create a typeform
2. Get the `formId` and `apiKey`
3. Create a Slack group
4. Create the `accessToken` for the Slack group
5. Fill in the `config` variable accordingly
6. Done!!
